## A Very Basic Snake Game Written in TypeScript for Fun

I am making a snake game in TypeScript for fun. TypeScript seems a pretty nice language since it is Object-Oriented and it can transpile to JavaScript.

I am also planning to use TypeScript for JavaScript projects as well!

TypeScript seems pretty fun!

## Controls
 - User arrow keys to move arround
 - `G` = Show Grid
 - `C` = No Clip Mode, go through self and walls
 - `J` = Slow down the snake
 - `K` = Speed up the snake
 - `SPACE` = Pause, Resume game
 - `RETURN` = start the game
 - `1 - 4` = Change levels
 - `0` remove level
 
 

## Development
 - Checkout the project and CD into it
 - run `npm install` to get all dependencies
 - run `npm run build` to compile the app
 - run `npm start` to get the game running on your browser




 ## Finally
This project should be working fine in your local machine. Just clone this repo to your machine, and then follow the instructions in the Development header.
